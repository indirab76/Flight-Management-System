The Flight Management System is a Java-based booking solution for flight tickets. It
consolidates data provided by different airline carriers and hence provides the user details
and rates in real-time. Travellers may want to make changes in their bookings. The
application allows them to book, cancel, view and update their bookings with ease. Other
than this, it eases the management of bookings too. All the bookings, flights, schedules and
routes can be viewed, added and modified on a single application by the administrator.
